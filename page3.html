            The Night King is the leader of the white walkers, a group of ancient humanoid creatures believed to be mythological, having not been seen for thousands of years. 
            Once humans, these "first men" were turned into white walkers by the supernatural children of the forest, who wanted to resist the humans encroaching on their land.
             This backfired, and the humans and children of the forest had to work together to build a massive wall of ice to keep the white walkers safely away from (mostly) everyone else.
